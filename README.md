# Setting Up the Home Cooked Meal WebSite

## Description

This Open Source Project will be a template in Aurelia for Shared Economy Projects.
The Concept for the Site is that a chef can sign up to cook their best meal(s) and charge per head.
A diner can search for chefs for a particular meal that they wish to eat.  The site will include
sign up through facebook, google, it will be responsive for mobile, and it will allow the user
to collect payment through paypal or stripe (credit card)

This site uses aurelia, bootstrap, and auth0 (for SSO) on the front ed.

The directions below will get you setup tog 

## Getting Started

You will need `jspm` to install some of the dependencies.

```bash
npm install -g jspm
```

Clone the repo, then:

```bash
npm install
jspm install
```

Run the application with a web server such as **http-server**.

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

You can also run directly out of visual studio 2015, which is why I included the web.config.

## Set Your Auth0 Credentials

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for your free Auth0 account.

Set your credentials in `Auth0Lock`. (currently my credentials are there)

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
